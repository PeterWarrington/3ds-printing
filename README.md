# 3DS Printing
## Network printing 3DS homebrew application

Supports Internet Printing Protocol and Port 9100 printing using PDF, PWG Raster, PCL or Plain text formats.

That being said, it doesn't work on my weird printer so I have no idea if the code works.

I wrote about this project on my blog: *Programming with printers - Don't. <https://www.lilpete.me/blog/printing>*
